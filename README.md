# Retro-Platformer-Game
In 1983, an arcade game produced by Activision titled Frostbite was released on 
the Atari 2600 in which the character Frostbite Bailey had to build igloos by jumping on a 
series of ice blocks while avoiding the arctic water, deadly enemies, and plummeting 
temperature. The purpose of this project was to design a game based on the 
mechanics of Frostbite while being keyboard-driven and having an alternate theme.
